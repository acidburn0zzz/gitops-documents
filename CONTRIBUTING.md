# CONTRIBUTING

This repository hosts lasting documents for the OpenGitOps project, which are versioned and released together.

In addition to contributions to the ongoing evolution of the GitOps [Principles](hhttps://github.com/open-gitops/documents/blob/v1.0.0/PRINCIPLES.md) and [Glossary](https://github.com/open-gitops/documents/blob/v1.0.0/GLOSSARY.md), OpenGitOps project is looking for additional types of content to help new and existing GitOps practitioners learn from each other on their journey.

These may include content initially envisioned in the [Work Products](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/blob/main/gitops-wg/charter.md#work-products-wip) section of GitOps Working Group charter: methodologies and approaches documents, a GitOps landscape document, or working examples for getting started.
Other content, such as white papers, case studies, architectural patterns, tool and technology comparisons, or tutorials, are also good candidates for inclusion.
Use your imagination!

It's encouraged to first discuss any ideas or questions asynchronously with the GitOps community using [OpenGitOps project discussions](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/discussions). 
These discussion topics are regularly highlighted in the twice-monthly community meetings, and in some cases, special teams are formed within OpenGitOps to collaborate on specific content topics raised in these discussions.
